# ETHTPS.info Privacy Policy

TL;DR: For ethtps.info visitors, we do not use cookies and we do not collect any personal data. If you decide to create an account, we ask for the bare minimum and only share it with services that are absolutely necessary for the app to function.

At ETHTPS, we are committed to complying with GDPR, CCPA, PECR, and other privacy regulations on our website and our web analytics product. The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours! — is a big deal to us.

In this policy, we lay out what data we collect and why, how your data is handled, and your rights to your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.

If you have placed the ETHTPS script on your website, take a look at our data policy for details on the information we do collect about your website visitors on your behalf.

We run the ETHTPS script to collect some anonymous usage data for statistical purposes. The goal is to track overall trends in our website traffic; it is not to track individual visitors.

Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need, and we will solely process this information to provide you with the service you signed up for.

We use a select number of trusted external service providers for certain service offerings. These service providers are carefully selected and meet high data protection, data privacy, and security standards.

We only share information with them that is required for the services offered, and we contractually bind them to keep any information we share with them as confidential and to process personal data only according to our instructions.

Here’s what that means in practice:

### What we collect and what we use it for

- We only store IP addresses for a limited amount of time, typically for a few hours, solely for the purpose of generating anonymous usage statistics that help us understand how our website is being accessed and used, and we do not use cookies for this purpose as we respect the privacy of our users and strive to protect their personal information.

- Another method through which we track usage data is by assigning API keys that are automatically generated and associated with your browser or device when you visit the website for the first time, or if you clear your browser data, or if you use a new browser altogether, allowing us to keep track of your usage activities and preferences while ensuring that your anonymity and privacy are preserved while also helping improve your and other visitors' experience.
